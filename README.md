## Hi there 👋 I'm Sareenah and I'm happy you've made it to my github!
I'm an analyst, financial auditor, copy writer and visual artist who is passionate about data driven story telling.
I strive to use or create clear and emotive visuals to deliver data in a contextual environment.

## Examples of My EDA Work using a combination of SQL, Python and Tableau #

#### [Blueberries & Bees Regression Modeling in Python, Dashboard in Tableau](https://slaing77.github.io/blueberries_and_bees/)

Examining environmental and species factors to determine the most important elements in producing volumous blueberry yields.  

#### [Salem Witch Trials EDA in Python](https://slaing77.github.io/salem-witch-trials/)

Exploring sentiment among the towns people and the level of support/resistence they provided the Minister at the centre of the "witch outbreak".

#### [Finding Bigfoot by Moonlight EDA in SQL, Dashboard in Tableau](https://github.com/slaing77/Finding-Bigfoot_by_moonlight)

Determining when sightings are most likely to be reported.  I used fractional moonlight measurements to track both moon and beast.
It turns out if you WANT a sasquatch encounter, avoid full moons and aim for a gibbous!

### You may get a kick out of this sweet Numerology calculator I created in Python. ##  
It reveals the personal Tarot cards of anyone, based on their date of birth. 
I ran one of my favorite authors through it and determined  _Mary Shelley's Soul Card is:  Strength  & her Personality Card is:  The Star_

with my deep domain knowledge of Tarot & Astrology, it was natural for me to capitalize on the enormous amount of astrology data that is freely available. 
I created an OpenAi astrology assistant, capable of calculating natal charts, planetary transits, and daily horoscopes - pushing them daily to my website.
this is one small piece of a larger app I am currently building.

its been an absolute joy engineering prompts for symbolic analysis.


My love of data driven story telling probably arises from my voracious (pre-covid, pre-Bootcamp) book habits.
After two cross country moves, and one house fire it seemed it was much more practical to switch from bound books, to digital books.
It was only a matter of time before I would want to learn how to create e-books and publications for myself.

## Literary Treat for You!

I've been working with 17th and 18th century literature, reliving some of my favorite classics such as The Tell Tale Heart, and Frankenstien.
I prepared an e-book of the  Mary Shelley's Frankenstien using Sigil, html and css. I created the cover art in photoshop, and wrote the forward.
If proto-science fiction and gothic horror are your thing, check it out!
