# Hi there 👋 I'm Sareenah and I'm happy you've made it to my github!
I'm a data analyst who is passionate for data driven story telling.

Feel free to explore some of my Bootcamp Projects:

[Blueberries & Bees Regression Modeling in Python, Dashboard in Tableau](https://github.com/slaing77/blueberries_and_bees)

Determining the most important factors in determining blueberry yields.  Examining environmental and species factors.

[Salem Witch Trials EDA in Python](https://github.com/slaing77/salem-witch-trials)

Exploring sentiment among the towns people and the level of support/resistence they provided the Minister at the centre of the "witch outbreak".

[Finding Bigfoot by Moonlight EDA in SQL, Dashboard in Tableau](https://github.com/slaing77/Finding-Bigfoot_by_moonlight)

Determining when sightings are most likely to occur.  I used fractional moonlight measurements to track both moon and beast.
It turns out if you WANT a sasquatch encounter, avoid full moons and aim for a gibbous!


#### You may get a kick out of this sweet Numerology calculator I created in Python.  It reveals the personal Tarot cards of anyone, based on their date of birth.

[Here's my Code](https://github.com/slaing77/Numbers-Cards-)

My love of data driven story telling probably arises from my voracious ((pre-covid, pre-Bootcamp) book habits.
After two cross country moves, and one house fire it seemed it was much more practical to switch from bound books, to digital books.
It was only a matter of time before I would want to learn how to create e-books and publications.

#### Literary Treats!

I've been working with 17th and 18th century literature, reliving some of my favorite classics such as The Tell Tale Heart, and Frankenstien.
I prepared an e-book of the  Mary Shelley's Frankenstien using Sigil, html and css. I created the cover art in photoshop, and wrote the forward.
If proto-science fiction and gothic horror are your thing, check it out!

[Here's my Frankenstien repository](https://github.com/slaing77/frank.github.io)

[E-Pub File](https://github.com/slaing77/frank.github.io/raw/main/frankenstein.epub)

[PDF file](https://github.com/slaing77/frank.github.io/raw/main/Frankenstein-SRL.pdf)

In case you were wondering, Mary's Soul Card is:  Strength  & her Personality Card is:  The Star
Very Fitting :)
